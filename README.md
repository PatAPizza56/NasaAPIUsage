# NasaAPIUsage

## About

This project is an example of how I can utalize an API in c#. I use the NASA API to allow users to select a date, and view either the picture of the day, or a mars picture from that day. This project contains the use of try and catch for error handling, as well as a dynamic api using class that is super easy to expand upon and use for other projects.
